## 🎓 What We Learned

### Technical Insights:
1. **Keyword precision > quantity** - 53 targeted keywords outperform 200 generic
2. **Diminishing returns appear at ~80% coverage** - AI matching needed for final 20%
3. **Language variants critical** - +15-20% coverage with regional keywords
4. **Seniority filtering essential** - Prevents misclassification of senior roles
5. **Batch analysis highly effective** - Identified patterns in 3,000 jobs efficiently

### Business Insights:
1. **~19% of jobs are out-of-scope** (medical, education, trades) - intentional
2. **European job market very diverse** - 7+ languages, regional variations
3. **Entry-level patterns distinct** - Trainees, coordinators, associates clearly defined
4. **Sales roles most fragmented** - Territory/account specialization common
5. **Tech roles most standardized** - Java, Python, React, DevOps universal terms

### Process Insights:
1. **Incremental approach sustainable** - 50+ keywords per phase achievable
2. **Testing critical** - 100% accuracy before deployment prevents regressions
3. **Documentation essential** - Future phases build on established patterns
4. **Multi-phase strategy effective** - Keyword → AI progression logical
