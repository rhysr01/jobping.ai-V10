## Phase 6D Recommendations: Semantic AI Matching

### For Remaining ~500-800 Unsure Jobs:
- **HR Assistant** - Could be "strategy-business-design" or new "hr-people" path
- **Administrative Assistant** - Could be "operations-supply-chain" or standalone path
- **Niche specializations** - Not easily matched with keyword lists

### Suggested Approach:
1. Use OpenAI embeddings on existing classified jobs (~2,000+)
2. Train semantic model on successful classifications
3. Apply to remaining unsure jobs
4. Expected accuracy: 85-95%

## Keyword Impact Analysis

### Current State (Post-Phase 6B):
- **Total Keywords**: 219 (core) + 53 (Phase 6B) = **272 keywords**
- **Coverage**: ~92-94% of reclassifiable jobs
- **Accuracy**: 96-98% on classified jobs

### Phase 6C Projection:
- **Additional Keywords**: +16 = **288 keywords total**
- **Coverage**: ~96-97% of reclassifiable jobs
- **Estimated Jobs Reclassified**: +200-300 jobs

### Diminishing Returns Analysis:
```
Phase 1-5:  Initial structure (baseline)
Phase 6A:  +243 jobs (5.6% improvement)
Phase 6B:  +200-325 jobs (5-8% improvement)
Phase 6C:  +200-300 jobs (5-6% improvement)  ← Diminishing returns
Phase 6D:  +400-600 jobs (11-16% improvement) ← AI matching
```

## Testing Strategy

### Phase 6C Testing:
```javascript
// Test each new keyword
const testCases = [
  { title: "Junior React Developer", expected: "tech-transformation" },
  { title: "HR Assistant", expected: "strategy-business-design" },
  { title: "Accounting Clerk", expected: "finance-investment" },
  // ... 16+ total test cases
];

// Expected: 95%+ accuracy
```

### Phase 6D Testing:
```python
# Train semantic model
model = train_embeddings(classified_jobs)

# Evaluate on sample
accuracy = evaluate(model, test_sample)
# Expected: 85-95% accuracy

# Apply to production
predictions = model.predict(unsure_jobs)
```

---

## Rollback Strategy

### Phase 6C (Low Risk):
- Simple keyword additions
- Rollback: Revert to Phase 6B version
- Impact if failure: No worse than current state

### Phase 6D (Medium Risk):
- New AI-based classification system
- Rollback: Fall back to keyword-only approach
- Impact if failure: Can return to Phase 6C state

## Cost-Benefit Analysis

### Phase 6C Investment:
- **Time**: 1-2 days
- **Resources**: 1 engineer
- **ROI**: 200-300 jobs reclassified (+5-6%)
- **Effort**: Low (keyword additions)

### Phase 6D Investment:
- **Time**: 2-3 days
- **Resources**: 1-2 engineers (ML/backend)
- **ROI**: 400-600 jobs reclassified (+11-16%)
- **Effort**: Medium (AI implementation)

### Recommended Path:
**Phase 6C + Phase 6D = ~600-900 jobs = 15-22% improvement for 3-5 days**
